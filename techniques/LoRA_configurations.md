# LoRA Configuration Guide

This guide provides practical advice for selecting optimal LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) configurations based on our experimental findings.

## Key Configuration Parameters

### Rank (r)

The `r` parameter defines the rank of the decomposition matrices and is the most important hyperparameter in LoRA.

| Rank Value | Parameters | Benefits | Drawbacks |
|------------|------------|----------|-----------|
| r=4 (Low)  | Fewer parameters, less memory | Fast training, more efficient | Limited capacity for complex tasks |
| r=16 (Medium) | Balanced approach | Good performance/efficiency trade-off | Moderate increase in parameters |
| r=32 (High) | More parameters | Higher performance ceiling | Slower training, less efficient |

**Our findings**: Increasing rank from 4 to 16 showed significant improvements, while going from 16 to 32 showed diminishing returns (only +0.34% accuracy increase).

**Recommendation**: Start with r=16 for most tasks. Use r=8 or lower for very resource-constrained environments, or r=32+ for tasks requiring maximum adaptation capability.

### Alpha (α)

The `alpha` parameter is a scaling factor applied to the LoRA weights during forward pass.

```python
h = h + (BA) * (alpha / r)
```

| Alpha Value | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| α = r | Standard setting recommended in the paper |
| α > r | Increases the impact of adapted weights |
| α < r | Reduces the impact of adapted weights |

**Our findings**: The standard setting of α=2r worked well for most configurations.

**Recommendation**: Set α=2r (twice the rank value) as a starting point.

### Target Modules

This parameter defines which layers in the model receive LoRA adaptation.

| Target Configuration | Description | Use Case |
|---------------------|-------------|----------|
| Query-only | Only adapt query projections | Maximum parameter efficiency |
| Q+K+V | Adapt query, key, and value projections | Balanced approach |
| Q+K+V+O | Adapt all attention modules | Better performance for complex tasks |
| All projection layers | Include intermediate and output projections | When maximum adaptation is needed |

**Our findings**: 
- "Query-Only" configuration used 70% fewer parameters than adapting all attention modules but showed 4.3% lower accuracy
- "Q+K+V+O" configuration provided the best performance/efficiency trade-off

**Recommendation**: Start with adapting all attention components (Q+K+V+O). If extreme parameter efficiency is needed, use query-only configuration.

### Dropout

LoRA dropout helps prevent overfitting by randomly zeroing activations during training.

| Dropout Value | Use Case |
|---------------|----------|
| 0.0 | Small datasets with risk of underfitting |
| 0.1 (Default) | Most use cases |
| 0.3 | Large datasets with risk of overfitting |

**Our findings**: Increasing dropout from 0.1 to 0.3 showed minor performance improvements on our dataset.

**Recommendation**: Use the default 0.1 as a starting point, increase to 0.3 for large datasets or if overfitting is observed.

### Bias Training

The `bias` parameter controls whether bias terms are trained alongside LoRA weights.

| Option | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| "none" | Don't train any biases | Maximum parameter efficiency |
| "lora_only" | Only train biases in layers with LoRA | Balanced approach |
| "all" | Train all bias parameters | Maximum adaptation capability |

**Our findings**: Using "lora_only" showed only marginal improvements (~0.2% accuracy gain) while increasing parameter count.

**Recommendation**: Start with "none" and only change if necessary for your specific task.

## Task-Specific Recommendations

### Sentiment Analysis (like this project)

```python
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    task_type=TaskType.SEQ_CLS,
    r=16,                        # Medium rank
    lora_alpha=32,               # 2x rank value
    lora_dropout=0.1,            # Default dropout
    target_modules=["q_lin", "v_lin", "k_lin", "out_lin"],
    bias="none",
)
```

### Text Generation/Completion

```python
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    task_type=TaskType.CAUSAL_LM,
    r=8,                         # Lower rank works well for generation
    lora_alpha=16,               # 2x rank value
    lora_dropout=0.05,           # Lower dropout for generative tasks
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj", "k_proj", "o_proj"],
    bias="none",
)
```

### Question Answering

```python
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    task_type=TaskType.SEQ_2_SEQ_LM,
    r=32,                        # Higher rank for complex reasoning
    lora_alpha=64,               # 2x rank value
    lora_dropout=0.1,            # Default dropout
    # Target more modules for complex tasks
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj", "k_proj", "o_proj", 
                    "gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj"],
    bias="lora_only",            # Include bias training
)
```

## Memory-Constrained Environments

For extremely limited GPU resources, consider these configurations:

### Extremely Memory-Constrained (< 8GB VRAM)

```python
qlora_config = LoraConfig(
    task_type=TaskType.SEQ_CLS,
    r=4,                         # Very low rank
    lora_alpha=8,                # 2x rank
    lora_dropout=0.05,           # Lower dropout
    target_modules=["q_lin"],    # Query-only for maximum efficiency
    bias="none",
)
```

Combined with 4-bit quantization (QLoRA), this configuration can run on consumer GPUs with minimal memory requirements.

## Experimental Approach

If you're unsure which configuration is best for your task, we recommend:

1. Start with a baseline configuration (r=16, α=32, all attention modules)
2. Run a quick experiment with a subset of your data
3. If performance is good but training is slow/memory-intensive, reduce rank and target fewer modules
4. If performance is poor, increase rank and consider targeting more modules

The beauty of PEFT techniques is that experiments are quick and resource-efficient, enabling rapid iteration.
